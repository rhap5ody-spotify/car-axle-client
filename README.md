# Running car axle client on your computer.

### Prerequisites

-   a internet connection
-   some computer knowledge
-   about 15 - 60 minutes (depending on your internet connection)
-   BEING ABLE TO READ **VERY** CAREFULLY
-   Be able to open html files in your browser

### Step 1: Downloading the files.

1. Now I recommend you start with the latest beta build, I always try to push something somewhat stable to the main branch so you should be fine. Now download the latest build of car axle client here:

-   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/car-axle-client/car-axle-client/main/dist/build.js (press cmd - s or ctrl - s to save it.)

2. You should save it to a folder named whatever you want, just make it in a safe place.
3. Now its time to download the games, you may skip this part if you are fine with the normal game hosters. Now download the games here:

-   https://github.com/car-axle-client/gay-hosting-v3

4. Make sure you download the archive and extract it once done. (Click the green code button and click download zip)

-   https://github.com/car-axle-client/gay-hosting-v3

5. Move the extracted folder CONTENT (THE THINGS INSIDE OF THE FOLDER) to the same folder as the build.js file. (Makes the next steps easier)

### Step 2: Setting up the html wrapper.

1. This is the easiest step. I already have a html wrapper for you to use. Now download the html wrapper here:

-   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/car-axle-client/utils/main/public/index.html (press cmd - s or ctrl - s to save it.)

2. Now save it to the same folder as the build.js file. (This is required)

### Step 3: Running.

1. If this doesn't work, you messed up one of the steps earlier or your school blocked opening html files.
2. Now open the html file in your browser. (Chrome for the best experience)
3. You should see the car axle client GUI, BUT YOU ARE NOT DONE!
4. Go to the game section and set it to `./`
5. If your games are in a different directory, set it to that directory.

6. IMPORTANT NOTE: MOST GAMES WONT WORK SINCE ITS HOSTED LOCALLY
